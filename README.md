# website


Though it pains me to be a Microsoft Product User, I'm writing this in the GitHub web editor because I need a website to host my project files.
Some of my projects, for fun, are NFT related. 
sr.ht ownership have made it very clear they'll suspend accounts and fire customers for being blockchain involved.
As a result, since my spiritually pure choice is foreclosed, I'm here in the cesspool with the normies, to see how others live.
It is, already, a nightmare.
The horrors persist, but so do we.
