Background and Lore:
--------------------

Molto Benny was born as a two eyed pizza slice in a Rare Pizzas Box. He thought to himself, "what if pizza were free?"... and his third eye popped out!

Molto Benny is the mascot of PizzaDAO. ( a DAO is like a group chat with a bank account, but it can get fancy )

PizzaDAO is all about free pizza parties. 
We hand out pizza to everyone, all over the world! 
This year on Bitcoin Pizza Day, we feasted and partied in Toronto and over 200 other cities! 

Part of every sale of any Benny will be used to fund pizza to be given away for free, because that's what Benny would want.
Ryan Makes will also be using part of every sale to buy laptops and other educational equipment for a learning center for kids with disabilities where he volunteers.

Ryan Makes has been a proud member of the PizzaDAO family for years, helping coordinate the DAO and parties like Toronto's Pizza Day. 
When asked questions like "isn't everything 'crypto' bad?" Ryan's locked-and-loaded answer is "The world is full of scams, but the pizza is real. PizzaDAO has never lied to me - promises made are promises kept. That's rare! Have a slice!"
